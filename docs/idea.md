# Prompt Journey App Idea

## Overview
Prompt Journey is a forum-style application where users share their "prompt journeys"—step-by-step experiences with AI prompts, tasks, and results. It's inspired by "vibe coders" who share coding processes to build successful businesses, focusing on community and learning over direct sales.

## Key Features
- **User Journeys**: Forum posts where users document prompt tasks, iterations, successes, and failures.
- **Awards System**: Daily, weekly, and monthly awards for the best-quality journeys (voted by community).
- **One-Shot Prompts**: Curated list of standalone prompts with example results for quick inspiration.
- **Other Features**: User profiles, tags/categories, search, comments, and sharing options.

## Target Audience
- AI enthusiasts, prompt engineers, content creators, and "vibe coders" who enjoy sharing processes.
- Beginners looking for prompt examples and advanced users seeking community feedback.

## Monetization (Future)
- Optional premium features like journey analytics or exclusive prompts.
- Potential partnerships or affiliate links, but core focus remains on community sharing.

## Inspiration
Modeled after successful creator communities (e.g., coding forums, dev blogs) where sharing journeys leads to organic growth and business opportunities.
